From the irritating conjunctivitis to the potentially serious corneal ulcer, the monsoon can pose significant threats to your ocular health.Don’t let rain ruin your vision: Essential eye care tips for monsoon, to prevent infections (Photo by Flickr). Don’t let rain ruin your vision: Essential eye care tips for monsoon, to prevent infections (Photo by Flickr). In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Palak Macwana, Consultant at Sankara Eye Hospital in Hyderabad, shared, "Conjunctivitis, often casually referred to as "pink eye," is the swelling or inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin, transparent layer of tissue lining the inner surface of the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye. A stye is a painful red bump on the edge of your eyelid, resembling an acne pimple, caused by a bacterial infection when a tiny oil-producing gland in your eyelash follicle or eyelid skin becomes blocked.She added, “Dry eyes occur when you're unable to produce enough liquid tears, known as aqueous fluid; this condition, medically termed kerato-conjunctivitis, can be caused by poor blinking habits while reading or looking at a computer screen for long periods, as well as a dry, indoor environment. A corneal ulcer is an open sore on your cornea, primarily caused by infection. Symptoms include a red, watery, and bloodshot eye; severe eye pain; and pus or other eye discharge. A corneal ulcer can lead to vision loss and blindness and is considered a medical emergency.” Here is the Summary of Common Eye Problems During Monsoon: Conjunctivitis: Often referred to as pink eye, this inflammation of the conjunctiva can cause redness, itching, and a gritty sensation.Stye: A painful red bump on the eyelid, caused by a blocked oil gland. Dry Eyes: Reduced tear production, exacerbated by air conditioning and excessive screen time, can lead to discomfort and blurry vision.Corneal Ulcer: A serious infection of the cornea, characterized by severe pain, redness, and blurred vision.Protecting Your Eyes:Dr Palak Macwana advised, “To take care of your eyes during the monsoon, avoid rubbing them, as this can introduce harmful bacteria or viruses. Always use clean, filtered water for washing your face and eyes to prevent infections. Dampness and stagnant water can create breeding grounds for mosquitoes, leading to eye-related diseases such as dengue fever or malaria. Ensure there is no stagnant water and use mosquito repellents. Avoid sharing personal hygiene items like handkerchiefs and towels to prevent the transmission of infectious bacteria and viruses. If you wear contact lenses, Dr Palak Macwana recommended, “Maintain strict hygiene by following proper cleaning and disinfection techniques. Avoid wearing lenses while swimming or in excessively humid conditions. A well-balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals is essential for good eye health, so include foods like carrots, spinach, citrus fruits, almonds, and fish in your diet, and stay hydrated by drinking enough water. Regular eye check-ups are essential, especially during the monsoon, to detect any underlying problems and provide appropriate treatment. If you experience any discomfort, redness, itching, or vision changes, consult an eye specialist immediately.”To summarise, you may consider the following tips to safeguard your vision during the monsoon -Hygiene First: Avoid touching your eyes with unwashed hands. Use clean, filtered water to cleanse your face.
                Combat the Germs: Maintain a clean environment, especially in damp areas. Use mosquito repellents to prevent insect-borne diseases.
                Personal Care: Avoid sharing personal items like towels and handkerchiefs.
                Contact Lens Caution: Follow strict hygiene practices for contact lenses. Consider removing them during heavy rain or storms.
                Nourish Your Eyes: Consume a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals for optimal eye health.
                Regular Eye Checks: Schedule regular eye examinations to detect any issues early on.
                By following these simple guidelines, we can keep our eyes healthy and bright during the monsoon. Prevention is always better than cure and hence, early detection and treatment are crucial for maintaining good eye health.
